ðŸ§ª #BDD Automation Framework

This repository demonstrates the use of **Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)** for software testing using tools such as **Cucumber**, **Gherkin**, and **Selenium/WebDriver**.
BDD allows collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders by using natural language to describe the behaviour of the system.

 
 #Tech Stack

- Java / Python / JavaScript (choose your language)
- Cucumber / Behave / Jasmine (based on language)
- Gherkin syntax for feature files
- Selenium WebDriver for UI automation
